# Contract Tests

## Requirements

1. [latest Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/installation)
2. [Ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) or [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache). (Note : only fully tested with `Ganache-cli`)

## Usage

A ((messy) specification for the tests that are run can be found under TESTSPEC.md.

### Running tests

Assuming that the repository has been cloned and client is built, from the `contracts` directory

1. run ganache-cli : `npm run ganache`
2. in a separate terminal window run :

   `npm run test`
